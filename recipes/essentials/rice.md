# Rice

This isn't a recipe, but rather a simple method of cooking the perfect white rice on stove-top. Rice to water ratio absolutely depends on the kind of rice you are using, make sure to make adjustments on your next trials until you get the exact texture you like, 1:1.25 cups rice to water ratio is a good starting point. I always use Thai jasmine rice so 1:1 rice-water ratio is perfect if you want a chewy, sticky but definitely not mushy texture.


### Ingredients 
- Cooking pot
- 1 cup of rice
- 1 cup of water 
  
### Instructions
1. Place 1 cup of rice in a pot
2. Rinse the rice ___3 times___ to clean off most of the starch.
3. Add the water and stir the rice with your finger, make a spiral pattern so most of the grains will be on the edge and less at the center. Cooked rice will be fluffier if you do this. This is the ___only___ time you will stir the rice.
4. Cover the pot and light the fire to medium heat until the water boils.
5. This is the most important step, when the water boils, put the heat as low as possible. Get a piece of cloth big enough for the pot. Use to cloth to cover the pot with the lid, this will allow most of the steam to be trapped inside the pot. Simmer for 10 minutes (15 minutes if more then 3 cups of rice). Turn the heat off and wait for another 10 minutes without removing the cloth and lid. 

There you have it, who needs a rice cooker the burner can do the job. Enjoy :)
