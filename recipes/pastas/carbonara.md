# Carbonara

### Ingredients
* 250g either spaghetti or linguine
* 125g cheddar
* 150g of meat [pancetta, bacon, ham or mix]
* 50g butter
* 3 egg yolks
* 3 cloves of garlic


### Instructions
1. Mince garlic, dice meat and set aside
2. Prepare the sauce: In a bowl, mix melted butter, grated cheese and egg yolk. Mix well until you get a creamy consistency. 
3. In a pot, put enough water for the pasta, add a tablespoon of salt, add a tablespoon of oil to prevent the pasta from sticking, boil for 8-10 minutes.
4. Once the pasta is cooked, separate the pasta and the water. You will have to use the water so reserve it for later.
5. In a pan, fry the meat until desired crispness, add in the garlic and saut√© for another minute. Once done toss the pasta and make sure to add about 100ml of water used for the pasta and mix. You want a moist pasta to evenly spread the sauce all throughout, the mixture of meat and water should be enough for this, adjust accordingly.
6. Turn off the heat and wait for the pan to cool down, you can also transfer to a large bowl. Allow pasta to cool just enough so that the egg sauce won't curdle when you mix them in. Add the sauce in, mix until it spreads out evenly, add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. 
7. Top it with parmesan cheese and serve.
